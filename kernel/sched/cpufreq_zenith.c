 * Zenith CPUFreq Governor (Zenithed-V4)
 * Originally developed by ENI exclusively for LO.
 * V3+ continued by XTENSEI.
 *
 * Hybrid governor with Energy Model awareness, display-state coupling,
 * thermal-aware throttling, and a self-calibrating multi-layer
 * auto-tune stack:
 *
 *   - V1 classifier      load + input rate; per-profile target every
 *                        ZENITH_AUTO_TUNE_PERIOD_MS
 *   - V2 state machine   per-cluster {efficiency, balanced, latency,
 *                        sustained_perf, thermal_recovery}, scenario
 *                        overlay (camera/render/audio/memstall),
 *                        cluster-aware capping, hysteresis + cooldown
 *   - V3 self-tuner      observes V2 transition rate and bumps
 *                        hysteresis/cooldown offsets to fit live load
 *
 * On top of the auto-tune stack:
 *
 *   - Glides (round/U/Z) frequency-shaping helpers
 *   - K1 migration_floor sticky cluster-arrival floor
 *   - K2 psi_cpu_floor   PSI-CPU-stall floor
 *   - K3 frame_overrun   vblank-driven rescue (drm_handle_vblank
 *                        producer hook in drivers/gpu/drm/drm_vblank.c)
 *   - M1 psi_mem_cap     memory-pressure cap
 *   - M2 uclamp respect  peer_ramp / migration_floor uclamp_min sub-gates
 *   - M3 peer_ramp_off   screen-off peer_ramp window
 *   - M5 K3 deep tier    deep-streak frame_overrun amplification
 *
 * Producer/consumer split:
 *
 *   - Producers: input_handler, drm_handle_vblank, screen_state,
 *     thermal_state, PSI sampler, kcpustat, comm-walk
 *   - Consumers: zenith_get_next_freq() (per-tick) and
 *     zenith_auto_tune_work() (per-classifier-window)
 *
 * Telemetry: 12 trace events under include/trace/events/cpufreq_zenith.h
 * plus the auto_tune_status, at_log, last_decision_path, profile_values,
 * zenith_stats, zenith_input_stats, auto_tune_v3_state, game_auto_state
 * RO sysfs attrs for live diagnosis.

/* Predictive up-shift via util-trend ring (tier 2a').
 *
 * The peak-headroom rescue (tier 2c) is reactive: it waits for
 * peak_headroom_starve_streak consecutive saturated samples below
 * the freq floor before lifting the cluster, which on a 16 ms
 * sampling cadence is 48..64 ms of starvation before the rescue
 * lands.  The pre-arm tier 2b' shaves one window off the front of
 * that.  This tier shaves two more by acting on a *trend*, not on
 * a level: when the recent util signal is rising fast enough to
 * predict that hispeed_load is about to be crossed, lift the
 * cluster to eff_hispeed_freq one or two ticks before the level-
 * triggered hispeed tier would have done so.
 *
 * Trigger:
 *   delta_x256 = (newest - oldest) over the last predict_up_window
 *                samples, expressed as 256ths of max_cap so the
 *                threshold is unitless.  The compare is
 *                delta_x256 >= predict_up_thresh.
 *   freq < eff_hispeed_freq (otherwise the lift is a no-op).
 *   peak_starve_count == 0 (don't double-fire with rescue / pre-
 *                arm; let those handle it once starvation has
 *                begun).
 *   peak_rescue_until_ns has expired (don't refire inside a
 *                rescue hold-down window).
 *
 * Effect:
 *   Lift freq up to eff_hispeed_freq, set tp_path = "predict_up".
 *   Counter slot ZENITH_STAT_PREDICT_UP records the firing.  The
 *   subsequent hispeed tier (2b) will keep the floor in place if
 *   load_pct actually does cross hispeed_load on the next tick;
 *   otherwise the cluster naturally falls back through the EAS
 *   ladder after the rate-limit window closes.
 *
 * Risk:
 *   Oscillation when the window is short enough to react to PELT
 *   noise.  Mitigated by:
 *     - Gating on peak_starve_count == 0 keeps predict_up from
 *       fighting rescue / pre-arm during sustained-high regimes.
 *     - Default thresh of 64 ( == 25%% of max_cap rise across the
 *       window) is conservative; testers can dial it down to 32
 *       (~12.5%%) for more eager prediction.
 *     - The lift is to eff_hispeed_freq, not policy->max -- the
 *       cluster still has the rescue / brutality tiers above it
 *       when the trend turns out to be a real climb.
 *
 * 0 disables the tier (legacy behaviour: hispeed entry waits for
 * the level signal to arrive).  predict_up_window minimum is 2
 * (need at least two samples to compute a delta) and maximum is
 * ZENITH_PREDICT_UP_WINDOW_MAX so the per-policy ring buffer
 * stays small.

 * (default 50): companion to predict_up that catches sharp single-

 *
 * Rationale: predict_up integrates over predict_up_window samples
 * (4 by default), so a workload that takes ~8 samples to reach the
 * cumulative threshold will not lift until the half-way point.  A
 * cold cluster wake-up or a freshly-foregrounded GUI task often
 * shows the steepest util_avg slope on the *first* sample after

 * Rationale: schedutil_cpu_util() already adds cpu_bw_dl() to

 * roughly one PELT half-life (~32 ms) for its util_avg

 *
 * auto_hysteresis_ms (default 2000): the classifier's chosen

 * promotes auto_eval_ms / auto_hysteresis_ms to profile-baked

 * tend to need both clusters at a usable freq within a few
 * milliseconds of each other.  In the legacy path, when one
 * cluster is woken into peak by predict_up / peak_prearm /
 * peak_rescue, the peer cluster has to climb from idle by
 * itself, paying a full hispeed warm-up window before its half
 * of the IPC chain runs at speed.
 *
 * The arming side: when a cluster lifts to eff_hispeed (or
 * higher) via one of the peak tiers, stamp a deadline on the
 * peer cluster's slot.  The reading side: while that deadline
 * has not expired, the peer applies a soft floor at
 * peer_ramp_floor_pct of policy->max so it is no longer sitting
 * at idle when the cross-cluster wake arrives.  Class-based, not
 * policy-based: BIG arms PRIME and vice versa.  LITTLE does not
 * participate -- it is rarely on the producing side of a peer-
 * ramp-worthy IPC chain, and floor-arming it would interfere
 * with the bg_util_scale_pct screen-off path on devices that
 * route low-priority work to the small cluster.
 *
 * Self-disarms on the deadline.  No streak / debounce: the
 * triggers (predict_up trend window, peak_starve_count >=
 * starve_streak, peak_prearm gate) already require multiple
 * samples worth of evidence, so by the time the peer fires we
 * have all the confirmation we need.  Re-armings just bump the
 * deadline forward; harmless.
 *
 * peer_ramp_window_ms == 0 disables both sides (no arming

 * fire) -- mostly useful for trace consumers that want to see
 * the arming events without having the floor influence freq.

 * here and stamp a deadline on this policy's

 * the first half of the new task's PELT warm-up.
 *
 * Per-policy, not class-level: this tracks "task arrived here"

 * migration_floor arms the *self* of an arrival.  No conflict.
 *
 * Self-disarms by deadline.  Re-armings just bump the deadline

 *
 * Detection runs in zenith_drm_vblank_event(), a new exported

 * the screen-state stale guard fires) just records the timestamp
 * and returns.  On subsequent calls the elapsed wall-clock delta
 * is compared against (zenith_drm_vblank_us + slack_us); if the
 * gap is wider, the renderer missed the budget.  Stamp a
 * deadline frame_overrun_window_ms in the future on the file-
 * scope zenith_frame_overrun_until_ns slot.  While the deadline
 * holds, every cluster's eval lifts to a soft floor at
 * frame_overrun_floor_pct of policy->max.
 *
 * Why a *new* exported function and not a reuse of
 * zenith_set_drm_vblank_us(): the existing setter takes the
 * vblank *period* in microseconds and is only called on
 * refresh-rate transitions (60 Hz <-> 120 Hz).  This patch needs
 * a *per-vblank* event, which is a different concept.  Decoupled
 * so a panel driver can wire up either, both, or neither
 * depending on what it knows.  When the panel driver does not
 * call zenith_drm_vblank_event(), the entire detection path is
 * a no-op (the deadline is never stamped) and the rest of the
 * governor behaves exactly as before -- same fail-safe shape as
 * the existing zenith_set_drm_vblank_us() path.
 *
 * frame_overrun_slack_us == 0 disables stamping (the producer
 * still updates last_vblank_ns so the next 0 -> non-zero
 * configuration change starts cleanly).
 * frame_overrun_floor_pct == 0 leaves stamping but suppresses

 *
 * Cold-boot default for slack_us is 0 (off).  Per-profile

 * third of a 60 Hz vblank period (16667 us).  Smaller and
 * routine driver / scheduler jitter trips the detector; larger
 * and an actual single missed frame (16667 us late) doesn't
 * trip it.  Window 50 ms covers about three 60 Hz frames or six
 * 120 Hz frames -- enough recovery time after a single miss
 * without holding a high-freq pin past a brief stall.

 * Track a governor-wide consecutive-overrun streak: bump on
 * each overrun, reset on each within-budget vblank.  In the
 * consumer (the K3 read site in zenith_get_next_freq()), once

 * outside any plausible jitter explanation, and the user has
 * already opted into the energy / responsiveness trade by
 * picking PERFORMANCE.  All other profiles ship at 0.
 *
 * Capped at 16 to keep streak overflow a non-issue (atomic_t

 *     that were flipped to default 1 in the auto-defaults round that
 *     mirrored audio_aware / render_aware, so the same init-time sync
 *     rule applies: zenith_init() must enable the key against the
 *     default scalar value.
 *   - zenith_game_auto_key and zenith_auto_tune_v3_key match scalars
 *     that were flipped to non-zero defaults in the wave-7
 *     auto-defaults round (game_auto = 1, auto_tune_v3 = 2), so the

 *     game_auto / auto_tune_v3 keys against their default scalars
 *     for exactly this reason.
 *   - Profile presets in zenith_apply_profile() must not silently
 *     toggle a feature scalar without also calling
 *     zenith_set_static_key(); doing so violates the invariant.  The
 *     four current presets (perf/balanced/battery/legacy) deliberately
 *     leave audio_aware / camera_aware / render_aware / psi_aware
 *     untouched for exactly this reason — they are user-managed
 *     opt-ins, not preset state.
 *   - static_branch_enable / static_branch_disable both sleep
 *     acquiring cpus_read_lock() but are safe from sysfs store
 *     context.  Do not call zenith_set_static_key() from the hot path

 * an *armed-mask* model: the V2 worker writes a bitmask of which
 * tiers should be active for the current state / flag set, and
 * the read site returns the profile-set tunable value if armed,
 * 0 (off) if disarmed.  User sysfs writes set per-knob bits in
 * tunables->auto_tune_override_mask which lock the read to the

 * vblank hook.  The intent is the same as a frame-pacing governor:
 * keep the freq high enough that the render pipeline is never the
 * critical path of a frame's compute deadline.  The implementation
 * differs from real frame pacing in that nothing in the kernel sees
 * vblank events directly.  Instead, userspace (a small daemon that
 * watches /sys/class/drm/card0-DSI-1/vrefresh, or SurfaceFlinger if
 * patched, or the existing Realme display HAL) writes the current
 * vblank period in microseconds to frame_budget_us whenever the
 * panel switches refresh rate.
 *
 *   60 Hz   -> echo 16667 ...
 *   90 Hz   -> echo 11111 ...
 *  120 Hz   -> echo  8333 ...
 *  144 Hz   -> echo  6944 ...
 *  off      -> echo     0 ...
 *
 * The floor itself is computed adaptively: shorter budgets need a
 * higher floor because the same compute must finish in less wall
 * time.  The formula is
 *
 *   eff_pct = frame_pace_floor_pct * 16667 / frame_budget_us
 *   floor   = policy->max * min(eff_pct, 100) / 100
 *
 * so frame_pace_floor_pct is the *60 Hz baseline*; it auto-scales
 * upward at higher refresh rates without userspace re-tuning.
 *
 * frame_budget_us = 0 disables the feature regardless of
 * frame_pace_floor_pct.  frame_pace_floor_pct = 0 disables the
 * floor while keeping the budget set (useful for tracing the
 * tracepoint without changing freq).
 *
 * Floor is capped by uclamp_max downstream so an explicit ADPF
 * power-efficiency hint still wins.

 *
 * When psi_aware=1, zenith_get_next_freq() reads the system-wide

 * dimension has its own integer-percentage threshold; if the live
 * average is at or above the threshold for that dimension, the final
 * freq is *capped* at the effective hispeed floor.  Rationale:
 *
 *  - PSI_MEM_SOME: heavy memory stall.  Pushing above hispeed wastes
 *    energy on cycles that mostly stall waiting for memory; the
 *    workload is memory-bound, not compute-bound.
 *
 *  - PSI_CPU_SOME: oversubscribed runqueue.  More than one task is
 *    waiting on the cpu; ramping the freq above hispeed doesn't make
 *    runnable tasks run, it just burns power on the one that *is*
 *    running.  Useful on big.LITTLE where a small cluster gets piled
 *    on by a wakeup storm before the load balancer migrates anything.
 *
 *  - PSI_IO_SOME: I/O-bound stall.  The cpu is waiting on storage or
 *    block I/O; freq ramps don't reduce wait time.  Symmetric with
 *    PSI_MEM_SOME.
 *
 * When the hispeed tier is disabled (eff_hispeed == 0) the cap is
 * policy->max -- i.e. a no-op fallback.  The three caps stack: any
 * dimension over-threshold lowers the freq to the hispeed floor (we
 * don't subtract three times; the cap is at most one floor down).
 *
 * The reader is RCU-free and lock-free: psi_system.avg[][] is updated
 * by the avgs_work delayed work and a single READ_ONCE is sufficient
 * to get a coherent fixed-point value.  When CONFIG_PSI is off or
 * psi_disabled is set, the helper returns 0 and the caps never fire.
 *
 * 0..100 range; values >100 rejected by sysfs.  0 disables the cap
 * for that dimension even with psi_aware=1 (useful for tracing the
 * helpers without changing freq).  psi_cpu_thresh / psi_io_thresh
 * default to 0 so out-of-box behaviour matches pre-N1: only the mem
 * cap fires when psi_aware=1.
 *
 * Default flipped from 0 to 1 in the auto-defaults round that
 * accompanies camera_aware: zenith is intended to be self-tuning, and
 * leaving the gate off meant the memstall cap shipped dormant.  The
 * out-of-box impact is a memstall reader gated by psi_mem_thresh = 50
 * (i.e. only fires under sustained heavy memory pressure); the cpu

 *     converted to a synthetic dC scale (30..70 dC across the 0..100
 *     pressure range) so the guardrail still works on platforms
 *     without a per-cluster thermal zone.
 *   - When the live skin temp >= ceiling_dc, the burst floor is
 *     suppressed for this tick and the existing auto_thermal_cap /
 *     thermal_util_derate path stays in charge.  ARMED state is
 *     retained -- as soon as temp drops below the ceiling on a

 *
 * Defaults reasoning:

 *     gate keeps it from firing outside detected games / sustained
 *     load.
 *   - floor_pct = 85 sits above hispeed_freq for every preset and
 *     below policy->max enough to leave the existing thermal path
 *     useful headroom.
 *   - thermal_ceiling_dc = 48000 (48 dC) is the user's 45..50 dC
 *     range midpoint.
 *   - disarm_grace_ms = 1000 keeps Alt+Tab snappy without bouncing
 *     on a single sub-threshold tick.

 *
 *   https://github.com/firelzrd/reflex/blob/main/patches/0001-Reflex-CPUFreq-Governor-v0.3.0r2.patch
 *
 * Reflex's insight: PELT util has a 32 ms half-life, so on a sudden
 * busy-from-idle transition the scheduler util signal lags real load
 * by ~96-200 ms. kcpustat (kernel idle-time accounting) gives us the
 * raw busy ratio over the last observation window without smoothing,
 * which is perfect as a *temporary* util floor. To avoid double
 * counting once PELT catches up, we decay the floor with PELT's own
 * 32 ms half-life so total coverage stays ~100% across the ramp.
 *
 * Reflex implements the decay in log-domain with a 256-entry LUT to
 * get 1 ms granularity.  For Android phones we trade that precision
 * for simplicity: we decay in 32 ms quanta with a single right-shift,
 * which is exact at half-life boundaries and a few percent off in
 * between.  That's well below noise floor for cpufreq decisions.
 *
 * The integration point is the upcoming patch that calls
 * zenith_kcpustat_blend() in zenith_update_{single,shared}.  This
 * patch adds the sampler and the blend helper but doesn't call
 * either, so it is a pure no-op until the integration patch lands.
 */

 * contribution should be negligible.  After 8 half-lives the floor is
 * 1/256 of its initial value, well past the point of mattering.

 * Sample CPU busy ratio over the last window via kcpustat.
 *
 * Two-phase: when the window has elapsed, phase 1 latches the new

 * runs on the next callback and computes the actual busy_pct delta;
 * this avoids racing time-of-day skew between the snapshot reset and
 * the busy% calculation in the same callback.
 *
 * busy_pct flows through an asymmetric EWMA (instant up, decay down

/* B10-3: optional per-cgroup PSI source (see ZENITH_PSI_CGROUP_PATH_MAX
 * and psi_cgroup_path).
 *
 * zenith_psi_cgroup is the resolved cgroup whose embedded psi_group
 * (cgroup->psi) the three zenith_psi_*_some_pct() helpers below
 * dereference under rcu_read_lock().  NULL means "use psi_system",
 * which is the pre-B10 behaviour and the default at boot.
 *
 * Gated on CONFIG_PSI && CONFIG_CGROUPS.  Without CONFIG_CGROUPS the
 * struct cgroup type is forward-declared only and cgroup_psi(),
 * cgroup_get_from_path(), cgroup_put() are absent; the cached pointer
 * and apply helper degrade to no-ops, the picker returns &psi_system
 * unconditionally, and the sysfs store accepts (and silently
 * discards) any path.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - zenith_psi_cgroup_apply() is the only writer.  It serialises
 *     mutators with zenith_psi_cgroup_lock, holds a refcount on the
 *     cached cgroup (via cgroup_get_from_path), drops the previous
 *     refcount with cgroup_put() after a synchronize_rcu() so the
 *     readers below have left their grace period.
 *   - zenith_psi_cgroup_active_path is the most-recently-applied path
 *     string.  Identical-path stores are no-ops, so repeat profile-
 *     bake or sysfs writes don't churn the cgroup ref.
 *   - The cgroup ref lives as long as the path is set; zenith is
 *     built-in (Kconfig: bool), so we never run a teardown path.
 *
 * Hot-path readers do a single rcu_read_lock() / rcu_dereference() /
 * READ_ONCE() / rcu_read_unlock(); RCU read-side critical sections
 * are essentially free under PREEMPT_RCU (no atomic, no memory
 * barrier on the load side), so this stays cheap when the feature
 * is on, and is identical to the pre-B10 read when the cached
 * pointer is NULL.

 * grace period closes, the kfree_rcu callback drops the old table
 * once everyone has moved on.

 * pointers index into, sized to ZENITH_COMM_LIST_MAX entries and
 * ZENITH_COMM_BUF_MAX raw bytes.  Empty CSV (just "\n" or "")

 *
 * Patch K v2 (Zenith x Kasumi awareness): after a successful
 * thermal_zone_get_temp() we ask Kasumi for the last *real* (un-
 * dampened) reading and prefer it over the framework value.  This
 * lets Zenith make burst-guardrail decisions on the truth even

 * different zone and overwrite kasumi_last_real_mc.  The window is
 * sub-millisecond and the guardrail is approximate (FSM thresholds
 * are degrees apart), so this is acceptable.
 *
 * Fallback: if the zone is unresolved (NULL / IS_ERR -- foreign SoC,
 * thermal subsystem not registered yet, etc.) or the read returns
 * an error, synthesize an approximate dC value from
 * arch_scale_thermal_pressure().  The pressure is a 0..1024 capacity-
 * reduction scalar; mapping 0..100% pressure linearly to 30..70 dC
 * gives the burst guardrail a reasonable best-effort estimate even

 *
 * Both paths are cheap (single load + one library call) so the
 * helper is safe to call once per zenith_get_next_freq().  No

/* zenith_tier_value - V2 tier-classifier accessor for Patch L knobs.

 *
 *   1. User sysfs override always wins.  When the matching bit is
 *      set in tunables->auto_tune_override_mask the read returns
 *      the tunable value verbatim and skips all V2 logic.  Profile
 *      changes clear the entire mask (zenith_apply_profile() at
 *      line ~10630), so a profile flip rearms V2 even after the
 *      user has poked individual tiers.
 *
 *   2. When auto_tune_v2_tiers is 0 OR at_local_tiers_active is
 *      false the read returns the tunable verbatim -- this is the
 *      pre-Patch-L code path, byte-identical.
 *
 *   3. Otherwise (V2 active, tier mask current) the read returns
 *      the tunable iff the matching tier bit is set in the V2's
 *      armed mask, else 0.  "Disarmed" means "treat as off for
 *      this V2 window" -- a knob the user enabled via profile but
 *      that V2 has decided is not appropriate for the current
 *      classified state.
 *
 * Read in the eval hot path; the override-mask short-circuit is
 * one branch + one load on the common case (no override).

 * floor tiers should be armed for the current state / flag set
 * and stamps the result into z_policy->at_local_tier_armed_mask.
 *
 * Mapping rationale (also documented at the ZENITH_AT_TIER_*
 * defines, kept in sync with zenith_at_apply_glides()'s state
 * switch):
 *
 *   LATENCY: this is the "we want fast wakeups" V2 state.  K1
 *   compensates PELT migration lag on inbound tasks; K2 lifts
 *   to hispeed when sustained CPU pressure says queueing is
 *   real.  Both are fits.  K3 needs vblank events that LATENCY
 *   doesn't necessarily imply -- gated separately on the FRAME
 *   flag below.
 *
 *   FRAME / GAME flags (independent of state): K1 catches the
 *   render-thread scheduling shuffle that scaling between
 *   clusters tends to trigger; K3 catches missed frames once
 *   the panel driver wires zenith_drm_vblank_event().  K2 is
 *   intentionally NOT armed here -- frame work doesn't
 *   correlate with sustained PSI pressure, and the 10s EWMA
 *   would be a cross-talk signal we don't want during gameplay.
 *
 *   EFFICIENCY / BALANCED: the "be conservative on freq" V2
 *   states.  Disarming all three tiers preserves the user's
 *   intent (battery / mid-line behaviour) even when the
 *   profile selected was PERFORMANCE/BALANCED.
 *
 *   THERMAL_RECOVERY: the V2 actions path already pulls down
 *   freq with thermal_pressure_continuous; layering K1/K2/K3
 *   floors on top would fight that.  Disarmed.
 *
 *   SUSTAINED_PERF: the V2 actions path already pins freq
 *   high; K1/K2/K3 floors on top are double-counting (the
 *   resolved freq is already at-or-above any of the floor_pct
 *   ceilings).  Disarmed -- not because it would be wrong but
 *   because it would be redundant.
 *
 * Cheap: O(1), one bitmask write under the policy lock.  Single
 * writer (V2 worker), single reader (eval path under
 * update_lock).

 *                tier engages at load 55, climb mode SNAP, freq_step
 *                15 %% per tick, no powersave bias, input boost
 *                150 ms with full decay tail, peak-headroom rescue
 *                AND prearm both on, render-floor and frame-overrun
 *                tiers tuned tighter, peer-ramp window 80 ms with
 *                screen-off variant disabled, predictive up tier
 *                tighter, PSI floors armed but with hispeed-headroom
 *                guards.  Tradeoff: best burst latency, highest
 *                steady-state power.  Preferred for scenario flips
 *                triggered by camera_aware / render_aware / sustained
 *                game-mode.
 *
 *   BALANCED     The default.  up_threshold ~75, hispeed tier at
 *                load 65, climb mode SNAP, freq_step 10 %%, mild
 *                powersave bias, input boost 100 ms with shorter
 *                decay, peak-headroom rescue on but prearm gated by
 *                hysteresis streak, peer-ramp window 50 ms with a
 *                short screen-off variant, frame-overrun deep tier
 *                gated by streak.  Tradeoff: best 95th-pct latency
 *                while keeping idle power close to BATTERY.
 *                Preferred for the audio-detect scenario flip.
 *
 *   BATTERY      Conservative everywhere it matters for residency.
 *                up_threshold raised, climb mode STEP not SNAP,
 *                freq_step ~5-7 %%, larger powersave bias, input
 *                boost shorter, peak-headroom rescue off (only
 *                prearm fires), render-floor gated by min runtime,
 *                peer-ramp window ~30 ms (just long enough to catch
 *                a real cluster wake without paying for noise),
 *                frame-overrun off, PSI memstall cap armed
 *                aggressively to throttle when memstall is the
 *                bottleneck.  Tradeoff: lowest screen-off and idle
 *                power, deeper drops on bursty foreground work.
 *                Preferred for memstall-detected scenario flip
 *                (audio + memstall + screen-off all push toward
 *                BATTERY).
 *
 *   LEGACY       Bug-for-bug compatible with pre-V4 zenith.  All
 *                post-V4 tiers (peak-headroom prearm, peer-ramp,
 *                migration-floor, frame-overrun, PSI floors,
 *                render-floor, predict-up) gated to 0 so the
 *                runtime path matches the original schedutil-plus-
 *                ondemand-plus-reflex hybrid.  Useful as a
 *                regression baseline and for users who have an
 *                existing tuning workflow that depends on the V4
 *                tiers being silent.
 *
 *   CUSTOM       (not in this table)  No profile applied.  Every
 *                tunable carries whatever sysfs left it at, which
 *                in practice is the ZENITH_DEFAULT_* values from
 *                the top of this file unless the user overwrote
 *                them.  This is the value reported by the profile
 *                sysfs node when no preset has ever been applied.
 *
 * Adding a new tunable that should track the profile: add a field
 * to struct zenith_profile_defaults below, fill in the value in all
 * four preset tables, and copy it from p->foo to t->foo at the end
 * of this function.  Forgetting any of those three steps will leave
 * the field at its module default for that profile, which is
 * almost always wrong.
 *
 * Profile-baked vs. global-only tunable split (audited 2026-05-07,
 * zenith-tunables-audit).  struct zenith_tunables exposes ~180
 * tunables; this function bakes the subset whose semantics differ
 * by user-picked profile.  Everything else is "global-only": set
 * once at zenith_create_tunables_data() time from the
 * ZENITH_DEFAULT_* constants and only mutated by direct sysfs
 * writes (no profile path touches them).
 *
 * BAKED (81 fields, in the same order as struct
 * zenith_profile_defaults below).  Adding a field here without
 * updating all four preset tables triggers the warning above; a
 * static assert is not feasible because the struct is anonymous
 * inside this function.

 *   Patch B10-3 (1 field):

 *
 * GLOBAL-ONLY (~100 fields).  Not enumerated individually; the
 * categories are:
 *
 *   - User intent / opt-in flags whose semantics are device-wide
 *     and not per-profile: audio_aware, render_aware, camera_aware,
 *     psi_aware, prefer_silver_aware, game_auto, auto_tune_v2,
 *     auto_tune_v3 (all of the seven static-key-gated aware-flags
 *     and tier switches plus auto_tune_cluster_aware,
 *     auto_tune_v2_signals, auto_tune_frame_pacing,
 *     auto_tune_sustained_gaming).
 *
 *   - Mode-style scalars whose semantics are device-wide:
 *     thermal_state, thermal_active, thermal_aware, screen_state,
 *     freq_step_adaptive, climb_mode_brutal_*, profile (the
 *     reported profile node itself), profile_auto.
 *
 *   - Hardware-shaped freqs that depend on the SoC's freq table,
 *     not the user's intent: hispeed_freq, light_load_freq,
 *     efficient_freq[N], eff_bin_*, up_delay_us.
 *
 *   - Auto-tune V2/V3 internals that the auto-tune state machine
 *     manages directly (auto_tune_eval_ms,
 *     auto_tune_hysteresis_ms, auto_tune_hysteresis_windows,
 *     auto_tune_cooldown_windows, auto_tune_v2_var_promote_thresh,
 *     auto_tune_util_rising_thresh_pct,
 *     auto_tune_render_rt_floor_pct, auto_tune_v3_interval_ms,
 *     auto_tune_v3_state, auto_tune_thermal_slope,
 *     auto_tune_thermal_pressure_pct,
 *     auto_tune_thermal_slope_pct, auto_tune_sat_load_pct,
 *     auto_tune_hi_sat_pct, auto_tune_lo_sat_pct,
 *     auto_tune_hi_events_x2, auto_tune_lo_events_x2,
 *     auto_tune_scenario, all of the at_log_* sysfs RO mirrors).
 *
 *   - PSI thresholds and adaptive-up internals that already key off
 *     other profile-baked tiers: psi_mem_thresh, psi_cpu_thresh,
 *     psi_io_thresh, up_threshold_adaptive (the adaptive value, as
 *     opposed to the on/off knob which is profile-baked).
 *
 *   - Boot-time and frame-budget knobs that are global by design:
 *     boot_boost_ms, boot_boost_decay_ms, boot_complete_auto,
 *     frame_budget_us, frame_budget_us_auto, frame_pace_floor_pct,
 *     fg_*_pct ratios that are not in the bake set above.
 *
 *   - Boost / wakeup secondary knobs whose primary on/off lives in
 *     the bake set: input_boost_decay_curve, input_boost_big_only,
 *     wakeup_boost_ms, brutal_decay_ms, hispeed_*_streak,
 *     hispeed_hyst_pct, hispeed_entry_streak, freq_stability_-
 *     margin_pct, sampling_down_factor's helpers (already-baked
 *     factor itself is the bake-set entry), boost_exit_extend.
 *
 *   - Stats / observability: zenith_stats_*, *_active mirrors
 *     written from the runtime path, prefer_silver_*_pct, and the
 *     prefer_silver_hot_threshold_pct / prefer_silver_hot_bump_pct
 *     pair (the on/off prefer_silver_aware lives in the aware-flag
 *     opt-in group above).
 *
 * Rule of thumb for new tunables: if the right value depends on
 * what the user picked in /sys/.../zenith/profile, add it to the
 * bake set below.  If the right value depends on the device's
 * hardware (freq table, cluster topology) or on the user's intent
 * to enable an opt-in detection path (an aware-flag), keep it
 * global-only.  Default values for both groups belong in the
 * ZENITH_DEFAULT_* block at the top of this file; the four preset
 * tables only need to override values that differ from the
 * BALANCED row, but the current convention is to fill every cell
 * for readability.

 *     is the path that fires when the user writes "balanced" /
 *     "performance" / etc to the profile sysfs node.
 *     profile_store will subsequently cancel_delayed_work_sync
 *     to drain any in-flight invocation.

 *                                        B-AUTO-4: cascade)

 *     converged; clear pending state and rearm.  Otherwise the
 *     pending target's first_seen timestamp gates the commit
 *     until auto_hysteresis_ms has elapsed.  When the timer
 *     fires we commit -- zenith_apply_profile under
 *     attr_set->update_lock plus zenith_refresh_rate_delays /
 *     zenith_invalidate_cache so cached per-policy state for the
 *     old profile does not leak forward.
 *   - active_profile *stays* at AUTO across commits; only
 *     auto_target reflects the engine's current pick.
 *
 * Cadence-zero path:
 *   - if auto_eval_ms == 0 the engine is paused.  The worker
 *     still rearms (default cadence 500 ms) so a userspace write
 *     to a non-zero auto_eval_ms re-enters the active path
 *     promptly, but the classifier is skipped and no profile
 *     mutation runs.  This makes auto_eval_ms = 0 a runtime
 *     enable/disable toggle without changing the work struct
 *     lifecycle.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - active_profile is read once outside the lock as an early-
 *     out so the cancel-in-progress path (profile_store on AUTO
 *     exit) does not deadlock on update_lock waiting for
 *     cancel_delayed_work_sync to drain.
 *   - all profile-bake mutation paths take attr_set->update_lock
 *     (mutex, sleepable) just like profile_store does, so the

 *   - cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() is a per_cpu pointer load with a

 *   - policy->governor_data is a regular pointer and is set in
 *     zenith_start() / cleared in zenith_stop().  We read it
 *     with READ_ONCE; if zenith_stop() concurrently NULLs it
 *     after our load, the worst case is a write into a struct

 *
 * Foreground proxy: uclamp_eff_value(p, UCLAMP_MIN) > 0.
 *   - On Android 12 the top-app cgroup sets a non-zero
 *     uclamp.min on the cgroup itself; the freshly-forked task
 *     inherits that effective value at fork time.
 *   - On a kernel without CONFIG_UCLAMP_TASK the inline returns

/* Patch B9-1: android_vh_arch_set_freq_scale observer.
 *
 * The hook fires from arch_set_freq_scale() in drivers/base/
 * arch_topology.c whenever the scheduler caches a new per-cluster
 * frequency-scale value (used downstream for capacity_orig_of() /
 * cpu_util_*() accounting).  The signal is unique compared to the
 * tracepoints zenith already consumes in two ways:
 *
 *   1. It fires after the freq write has *taken effect*, not after
 *      zenith decided to write it.  On platforms that route the
 *      actual freq change through firmware / SCMI / a separate fast
 *      switch, drift between decision and realisation is real.
 *   2. It also fires for clusters zenith does *not* drive (e.g. on
 *      a hetero SoC where the BIG cluster is on schedutil and the
 *      LITTLE on zenith).  This gives zenith cross-cluster
 *      activity awareness without coupling to either governor's
 *      internal state.
 *
 * Use is opt-in via tunables->vh_arch_freq_scale_enable (default
 * 0).  When the gate is off the probe is a single READ_ONCE plus a
 * branch -- the cost on hot platforms (where this fires per
 * fast-switch) is dominated by the policy lookup.  When on:
 *
 *   - cache the realised scale in z_policy->vh_arch_freq_scale_-
 *     last (WRITE_ONCE; readers see torn-write-safe values)
 *   - if the scale jumped by >= ZENITH_VH_ARCH_FREQ_SCALE_STEP
 *     compared to the prior cached value (~5%% of SCHED_CAPACITY_-
 *     SCALE; filters governor-noise re-evaluations of the same
 *     OPP), arm the peer cluster's peer_ramp window so a peer
 *     governor's lift pre-warms us before the next eval window.
 *
 * Concurrency:
 *   - The probe runs in arbitrary scheduler context.  No sleeping
 *     primitives.  cpufreq_cpu_get_raw() is per_cpu pointer load
 *     plus a cpumask_test_cpu() check; no locks, no RCU writes.
 *   - z_policy->governor_data is the same READ_ONCE pattern the
 *     existing zenith_probe_wakeup_new() uses (see comment block
 *     above that function for the unregister-vs-free ordering
 *     argument; identical reasoning applies here because we
 *     register / unregister via the same trace-point lifecycle in
 *     zenith_gov_init()).
 *   - zenith_peer_ramp_arm() takes no locks; it reads the
 *     tunables window via READ_ONCE and writes a static atomic64
 *     via atomic64_set.  Safe to call from this context.

 *
 * Read-only observer: the hook permits inspection but not mutation
 * of the task; we only stamp the timestamp.  The tracepoint fires
 * from sched_move_task() in kernel/sched/core.c, called by the
 * cgroup attach / migration paths -- preemptible kernel context, no
 * rq lock held at the trace-point.
 *
 * Concurrency: same lock-free contract as B9-1 / B9-2 / B9-3 /
 * B9-3+.  cpufreq_cpu_get_raw + READ_ONCE on governor_data is the
 * established pattern; the timestamp write is WRITE_ONCE on a
 * per-policy unsigned long.  Multiple concurrent moves landing on
 * different CPUs of the same policy are last-writer-wins, which is
 * acceptable: any consumer only cares about the recency of the
 * most recent move, and a torn jiffies write would only delay the
 * stamp by one move.  No governor lock is taken.
 *
 * Filtering: a NULL tsk is impossible at the trace site (the kernel
 * always passes a real task to sched_move_task) but we defensively
 * check anyway so the probe is robust to future refactors.  Tasks
 * whose task_cpu() is not in a zenith-driven policy are silently
 * dropped, mirroring the B9-2 / B9-3+ behaviour.
